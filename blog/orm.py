# ORM = object relational mapping layer

# object relational mapper(ORM):
#  ==>SQL ALCHEMY
#  ==>DJANGO ORM

# Convert data between incompitible type system using object orianted programing language

# applicatation  == > orm(python to sql) ==> database

# sql 
# structured query language
# allows to access and manipulate database
# standeard language for dealing with relational database
# mysql
# postgresql
# oracle

# why orm ?
# developer writes the python code insted of sql to :
# create
# update 
# delete schema
# allow the write in the language you are already useing
# easy to switch from mysql to postgresql
# batter if we dont use sql sql provieds batter perfomance

# applicatation ==> orm(python to sql) ==> adaptor/driver ==>database
# adaptor/driver ==> allowes software component enabling a python application to interact with a database

# driver 
# pycog2 for postgresql
